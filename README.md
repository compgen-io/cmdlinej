cmdlinej - Library for setting up and configuring command line programs
========

Using this library and it's annotations will make writing command-line programs in Java 
easier. This code was refactored out from a few different projects to produce a working 
library that can be included in any project to make the process of setting up a command-line
program significantly easier.

Examples to follow... for now, see the code in src/test.
